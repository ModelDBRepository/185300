Abstract: Recent single cell studies show extensive molecular
variability underlying cellular responses. We evaluated the impact of
molecular variability in the expression of cell signaling components
and ion channels on electrophysiological excitability and
neuromodulation. We employed a computational approach that integrated
neuropeptide receptor-mediated signaling with electrophysiology. We
simulated a population of neurons in which expression levels of a
neuropeptide receptor and multiple ion channels were simultaneously
varied within a physiological range. We analyzed the effects of
variation on the electrophysiological response to a neuropeptide
stimulus. Our results revealed distinct response patterns associated
with low versus high receptor levels. Neurons with low receptor levels
showed increased excitability and neurons with high receptor levels
showed reduced excitability. These response patterns were separated by
a narrow receptor level range forming a separatrix. The position of
this separatrix was dependent on the expression levels of multiple ion
channels. To assess the relative contributions of receptor and ion
channel levels to the response profiles, we categorized the responses
into six phenotypes based on response kinetics and magnitude. We
applied several multivariate statistical approaches and found that
receptor and channel expression levels influence the neuromodulation
response phenotype through a complex though systematic mapping. Our
analyses extended our understanding of how cellular responses to
neuromodulation vary as a function of molecular expression. Our study
showed that receptor expression and biophysical state interact with
distinct relative contributions to neuronal excitability.

The "actual model" (representation of the properties of the original
biological system) is identical to what was used in Makadia, H.K.,
Anderson, W.D., Fey, D., Sauter, T., Schwaber, J.S., and Vadigepalli,
R. (2015). Multiscale model of dynamic neuromodulation integrating
neuropeptide-induced signaling pathway activity with membrane
electrophysiology. Biophys. J. 108, 211-223 (code available at ModelDB
entry 156830).  However, the current entry contains code to implement
parameter variations key to our recent analysis (Anderson WD, Makadia
HK, Vadigepalli R (2015) Molecular variability elicits a tunable
switch with discrete neuromodulatory response phenotypes. J Comput
Neurosci).

Instruction to run key simulations:

The following command in MATLAB will implement the model:

>> [firing_rate] = runModel([1,1,1,1,1,1]); 

The input the the function runModel() is a vector of weights to the following molecular species:

AT1R, gNa, gKdr, gKa, gKahp, gCaL

The following code produces the traces shown in Fig 3A:

>> [firing_rate] = runModel([1, 1, 1, 1, 1.05, 0.95]); 
>> [firing_rate] = runModel([1, 1, 1.1, 1, 1, 0.9]); 
>> [firing_rate] = runModel([1 ,0.92, 1, 1.05, 1, 1]); 

It takes about 15 minutes to generate one of these traces on a 2012 macbook pro laptop.
